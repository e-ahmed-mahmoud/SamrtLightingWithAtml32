# SamrtLightingWithAtml32
smart light system using Atmel 32 MCU and sensors (PIR, LDR, ultrasonic) where controlling in ON/OFF of leds 
Project Objective: 
â€¢	controls in all lighting at house to work smart and save energy 

Project Components : 
  1. An ATmega 16 microcontroller board 
  2. PIR sensor.
  3. ULTRASONIC sensor  .
  4. Relay 4 channel.

Project Description:
1.	LDR  sense the day light then  give reading to microcontroller .
2.	Microcontroller analyze the reading to make  decision for active sensors or not
3.	When sensor active at night or dark places this start to detect the motion or distance of bodies and then give reading to microcontroller to chose any light source will be on
4.	Then microcontroller give pulse on relay channels for lighting on .
